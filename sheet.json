	"instructions": "This sheet is designed for use with the full release of DnD 5th edition.  Where possible, it supports the 'rules as written' as listed in the Basic DnD PDF that's freely available for download, and the Players Handbook (PHB) that was released in August 2014.  Sheet help is available on the roll20 wiki - https://wiki.roll20.net/DnD5e_Character_Sheet  Note: This sheet is NOT compatible with the older playtest ruleset (DnD Next) and if you are still using the Next rules you should use the older, and no longer maintained, DnD Next sheet instead.  It's also advisable to avoid trying to transfer existing characters between this and the older 'Next' sheet as they are not fully compatible."
